## Title of proposal: 
gnosis-safe-mintr-app-mvp

## Description:
Create a [Gnosis Safe App MVP](https://blog.gnosis.pm/introducing-gnosis-safe-apps-faef908f69c6), enabling [Synthetix Mintr](https://mintr.synthetix.io/) as an App for Gnosis Safe teams straight from the [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/) multisig.
	

## Motivation: 
Combined, there are over $600M in assets stored in Gnosis multisig wallets. These funds currently donâ€™t have an easy way to enter the growing DeFi ecosystem. We think we can help bring the next $1bn to DeFi.

Given that the Gnosis Safe multisig has become the most trusted platform to store digital assets, it is natural to think that enabling teams to interact with platforms and protocols straight from the Gnosis Safe interface would bring a lot of value to both teams and volume to these platforms and protocols.


## Additional information: 

### Value
- Gnosis Safes users will have access to Synthetix Mintr features straight from the Safe UI itself, without requiring any extra steps, removing complexity and potentially risky asset management.
- Synthetix ecosystem will gain large adoption and a potential enormous volume of digital assets.

### Deliverables
- An Open source, tested and fully-working Synthetix Mintr Safe App MVP.

### Assumptions
- Specifications may change during the project definition and scope discovery.
- Synthetix subgraph and smart contracts are working as described in the documentation.
